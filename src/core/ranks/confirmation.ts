/**
 * Boss promotion confirmation (D126).
 *
 * Two eras, and the join between them is the whole design:
 *
 * - **Before `from`** every point is walked by the legacy rule, unchanged —
 *   the same function, the same immediate promotion, the same sustained
 *   demotion — so a rank a user already held on the activation day is the
 *   rank they keep. The activation day itself is legacy on purpose.
 * - **From `from` on** a promotion has to be *confirmed*: the next rank is
 *   awarded only once the rating has been at or above its threshold on
 *   `RANK_PROMOTION_CONFIRMATION_DAYS` eligible days in a row. A day is
 *   eligible when it is strictly before today, was scored, and was not
 *   paused. Everything else — today, an open day, a neutral day, a paused day
 *   — is transparent: it neither counts nor resets. A scored day below the
 *   threshold resets the count to nothing.
 *
 * One target at a time. The dates collected for one rank can never confirm
 * another, a rating already two thresholds up still advances one rank per
 * confirmation, and each promotion starts the next target from zero.
 *
 * **Demotion is not touched.** The new walk runs the same demotion step the
 * legacy walk runs, on every point, today's and unscored ones included, with
 * the counter carried across the boundary. The confirmation rule replaces
 * the promotion branch and nothing else.
 *
 * Pure. Same days, same boundary, same today: same result, byte for byte.
