/**
 * The Gym rating: **40 % attendance, 60 % personal development.**
 *
 * This is the decision phase 4 left open (D88), and the shape of it is worth
 * stating before the code, because two readings of "Gym rank" are possible
 * and only one of them is this app's:
 *
 * > A Gym rank is a statement about **the user against their own history**,
 * > never about the user against anyone else. Someone pressing 30 kg who
 * > trains three times a week and adds a rep a month outranks someone
 * > pressing 120 kg who turns up occasionally and has not moved in a year.
 * > Absolute strength is a real thing and it is not measured here — that is
 * > what Tombstones are for (D95).
 *
 * ```
 *   target = 0.40 × attendanceScore + 0.60 × performanceScore
 *   rating ← rating + (target − rating) × movementFactor(rating, target)

 * | best set of the day | `performance.ts` (D84, unchanged) |
 * | effective load | `load.ts` |
 * | 70/30 muscle influence | `muscles.ts` |
 * | trend and year-to-date windows | `performance.ts` |
 * | change % → 0–1000 | `score.ts` |
 * | attendance → 0–1000 | `score.ts` |
 * | the fold below | here |
 * | first-promotion gate | `endurance.ts` |
 * | abstinence decay | `decay.ts` |

 * ```
 *
 * which with the approved numbers is 10 % of the gap at or below 500, and
 * then a straight line down to nothing at 1000: 6 % at 700, 2 % at 900.
 *
 * **This is the smallest function that satisfies the rule**, and each half of
 * it is there for a stated reason:
 *
 * - *Higher ratings are harder to climb.* Not because the performance is
 *   worth less — it is not, and that is the next point — but because the
 *   distance from Master to Champion should ask for more sustained evidence
 *   than the distance from Rookie to Challenger.
 * - *The Performance Score itself is never touched.* Two users who both
 *   improved 8 % get exactly the same Performance Score and the same target;
 *   what differs is how fast the rating walks towards it. A rank must never
 *   change what a performance is worth, only how long it takes to bank it.
 * - *Ordinary progression stays at the approved 10 %.* The scaling is 1
 *   throughout the lower two thirds of the scale rather than starting to bite
 *   immediately, so the moderate responsiveness that was approved is what a
 *   normal user actually experiences.
 * - *Falling is not slowed.* A high rank buys no protection from a decline;
 *   if it did, a rating could only ever ratchet upwards. Maintenance is the
 *   one rule that holds a rating up, it is explicit, and it has conditions.
 *
 * Monotone non-increasing in the rating, and the `min` meets at rating = 500
 * where both of its branches are 1.
 *
 * The *factor* does step where the target crosses the rating — a climb from
 * 900 moves at 2 % and a fall from 900 at 10 % — but **the movement it
 * produces does not**, because the step happens exactly where the gap it
 * multiplies is zero. `(target − rating) × factor` is continuous in both
 * arguments everywhere, which is the quantity the rating actually sees and
 * the one the tests assert.

 * under the target, nothing more, which is why the rule stays narrow:
 *
 * - positive performance still raises the rating, because the blended target
 *   is above the current rating on its own and the floor never applies;
 * - negative performance still lowers it, because the change is then outside
 *   the tolerance and the rule does not fire at all;
 * - missed attendance still lowers it, for the same reason;
 * - abstinence decay is untouched — it is not a target, and the month-13
 *   schedule applies to a maintaining user exactly as it does to anyone else.
 *
 * The tolerance is ±0.25 percentage points. Aggregating ratios across groups
 * leaves floating-point dust in the last few bits, which without a tolerance
 * would flick Maintenance on and off between two replays of identical data;
 * a quarter of a point is far below one rep or one micro-plate on any real
