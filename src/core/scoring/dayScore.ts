 *   were **due**, so an unanswered item is a miss and drags the day down.
 * - **`recorded`** is for the rating. It divides by the items actually
 *   **answered**, because dividing by items due conflates not doing a thing
 *   with not saying so, and would make honestly logging partial progress cost
 *   more than staying silent.
 *
 * ### `flat`
 *
 * One mean over every question. What RC2 and iteration 2 up to phase 2 did,
 * and what every day scored under those builds keeps.
 *
 * ### `categoryMean`
 *
 * The mean **within** each category, then the equal-weighted mean of those.
 * Six questions about the household cannot outweigh the one that asks how the
 * user actually feels, and adding a seventh cannot quietly change what the
 * others are worth.
 *
 * The two numbers treat an absent category differently, and deliberately:
 *
 * - For **`recorded`**, a category with nothing answered has no data and
 *   leaves the denominator with it. It never contributes a zero it did not
 *   earn — which is the whole reason the rating uses this number.
 * - For **`score`** on a closed day, every category with something due
 *   participates, and one where nothing was answered contributes 0, because
 *   those items were genuinely missed. That is the flat model's own rule,
 *   applied per category rather than changed.
 *
 * The second is harsher than the flat model for a user who answers one
 * category and skips the others — three categories where only Mental was
 * answered read (0 + 0 + 80) / 3 rather than 80 × 4 / 7. That is the
 * arithmetic equal weighting asks for, in both directions.
