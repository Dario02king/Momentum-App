 * Everything downstream — activation, the ledger, the Boss weighting — reads
 * this table instead of hard-coding a list.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **`mental` is the stored name of Wellbeing.** Renaming a discriminator
 *    every answer row references would be a data migration in exchange for a
 *    label, and the label belongs in the string layer.
 * 2. **`sports` is not in `DOMAIN_TYPES`.** RC2's generic Sport domain is
 *    history that still has to type-check and still has to be replayable; it
 *    is not a domain anyone can hold. Anything iterating live domains must
 *    iterate this list and will therefore never resurrect it.
