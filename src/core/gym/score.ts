/**
 * Turning a performance *change* into a 0–1000 Performance Score.
 *
 * This is the piece phase 4 deliberately left open (D88): performance is a
 * rate of change, the rating is a level, and nothing said what rate equalled
 * what level. It is now one function with one parameter.
 *
 * ## The curve
 *
 * ```
 *                            1000
 *   score(x) =  ────────────────────────────
 *                 1 + ODDS ^ (−x / DECADE)
 * ```
 *
 * with `ODDS = 4` and `DECADE = 10` percentage points — a logistic curve
 * written in base 4 rather than base e, because in that form it says
 * something a reader can hold on to:
 *
 * > **Every ten points of improvement multiplies the odds by four.**
 *
 * The score's odds are `score / (1000 − score)`. At 0 % they are 1:1, which
 * is 500. At +10 % they are 4:1, which is 800. At −10 % they are 1:4, which
 * is 200. Nothing else needs to be memorised, and the single constant can be
 * retuned without any of the properties below changing.
 *
 * ## The properties it has to have, and why each one holds
 *
 * | Required | Why it holds |
 * |---|---|
 * | `score(0) = 500` | `ODDS^0 = 1`, so the denominator is exactly 2. Exact, not fitted. |
 * | symmetric about 500 | `1000 − score(x) = score(−x)` is an identity of the logistic, exact in algebra and exact to the last bit in the stable form used below. |
 * | monotonic | the exponent is strictly decreasing in `x`, so the denominator is too. |
 * | diminishing returns | the logistic's slope is maximal at `x = 0` and falls monotonically as `|x|` grows, which is the definition of diminishing marginal reward. |
 * | continuous at 0 | one expression over the whole line; there is no branch on sign that changes the value, only one that keeps the exponential in range. |
 * | bounded 0–1000 | the denominator is always > 1, and → 1 or → ∞ at the extremes. |
 * | no cap on the input | a beginner tripling their best set is +200 %, which scores 999.999. Large gains keep helping and keep helping less. |
 * | deterministic | pure arithmetic on a double; the same input gives the same bits every time. |
 *
 * ## The fit against the approved anchors
 *
 * ```
 *   change    approved    curve      note
 *    −20 %          0      58.82     see below
 *    −10 %        200     200.00     exact
 *     −5 %        330     333.33     +3.33
 *      0 %        500     500.00     exact
 *     +5 %        670     666.67     −3.33
 *    +10 %        800     800.00     exact
 *    +20 %        950     941.18     −8.82
 * ```
 *
 * **The anchor table cannot be satisfied as written, and the specification
 * says which way to resolve it.** −20 % → 0 and +20 % → 950 are not
 * symmetric: symmetry about 500 requires that if +20 % scores 950 then −20 %
 * scores 50. And an asymptotically bounded curve cannot reach exactly 0 at a
 * finite input at all — a function that hits 0 at −20 % either stops being
 * monotonic below it or clips, and clipping would make every collapse worse
 * than −20 % indistinguishable from every other. The approved priority order
 * puts `score(0) = 500`, monotonicity, symmetry and diminishing returns above
 * closeness to the table, so the two ±20 % anchors are the ones that give.
 * Every other anchor is met exactly or within 3.4 points.

 * −99.9 % and a gain of +100000 % both land on a real number, and the two
 * branches agree exactly at their shared boundary, x = 0, where each is 500.
