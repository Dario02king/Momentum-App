 * hash mirrors it, so a link can name a place (`#/progress/gym`) and the
 * browser's Back button walks the places the user actually visited.
 *
 * The hash is a mirror, not a second state: `navigate` writes the state and
 * the hash together, and a `popstate` reads the hash back into the state.
 * Nothing else touches either. Sheets, edit windows and onboarding are not
 * places and never enter the URL.
 *
 * The area is kept in the state even while another tab is open, so coming
 * back to the terminal restores the area that was being looked at; the hash
 * carries it only where it applies.
