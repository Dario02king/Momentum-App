/**
 * The Gym rating, assembled from what is stored and nothing else.
 *
 * The arithmetic is all in `core/gym/*` and none of it is here; this module's
 * job is to feed it truthful inputs — which day was scored, what the week's
 * target was, what the user had actually lifted by each day, and which
 * scoring era each day belongs to.
 *
 * ## Two eras, joined the way the Boss joins its own
 *
 * A config snapshot with no `gymModel` was written before this model existed,
 * and the days it covers are scored the way they were actually scored: the
 * shared EWMA over attendance. From the first snapshot that carries
 * `attendancePerformance`, the new fold takes over — **continuing from the
 * number the old one left**, so the day the update lands moves the rating by
 * one ordinary step rather than by a jump. Upgrading the app must neither
 * create progress nor take it away, and that rule does not stop applying
 * because the domain is Gym rather than the Boss (D68a, D90).
