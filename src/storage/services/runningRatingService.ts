/**
 * The Running rating, assembled from what is stored and nothing else.
 *
 * A deliberate near-twin of `gymRatingService`. The two domains differ in
 * exactly one place — what a performance observation *is* — and everything
 * downstream of that is the same shared code (`core/scoring/*`). Keeping the
 * two services parallel rather than merging them into one generic replay is
 * the smaller cost: their storage shapes and their windows are genuinely
 * different, and a single abstraction over both would have to carry a
 * discriminator into every line.
 *
 * ## Two eras, joined the way Gym joins its own
 *
 * A snapshot with no `runningModel` predates phase 5, and the days it covers
 * are scored the way they were actually scored: the shared EWMA over
 * attendance. From the first snapshot carrying `attendancePerformance` the
 * new fold takes over, **continuing from the number the old one left**, so
 * the day the update lands moves the rating by one ordinary step rather than
 * by a jump.
