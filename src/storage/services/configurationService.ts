 *    A user who skips Running has no running domain at all, and scoring
 *    therefore excludes it rather than scoring it as zero.
 * 2. Every scoring-relevant change appends a configuration revision, so a
 *    past day is always read back through the configuration it was lived
 *    under. Changing the language does not, because it changes nothing that
 *    is scored.
 * 3. **Nothing here can create the generic `sports` domain.** There is no
 *    parameter for it and no branch that reaches it. It survives as a stored
 *    discriminator so a device carrying RC2 history can still replay it, and
 *    that is the whole of its remaining role.
