/**
 * The confirmation era's one stored fact, and the reconciliation of its
 * pending state (D126).
 *
 * ## Activation
 *
 * `ensurePromotionConfirmation` runs on every configuration load. The first
 * time it finds no state it writes one: `from` is the **next** local day, so
 * the activation day — whatever the legacy rule awards on it, including a
 * promotion later that same day — stays entirely legacy, and the new rule
 * begins on a day that is still today and therefore cannot count until it
 * has become yesterday. Every later call finds the state and does nothing.
 * The boundary is never moved.
 *
 * An old backup carries no state, so restoring one on a device activates a
 * fresh prospective boundary on the next load; a newer backup carries its
 * own `from`, which is kept exactly, and its dates are reconciled from it.
 *
 * ## Reconciliation
 *
 * The pending dates are persisted because the product model asks for the
 * unique qualifying set to be on record. They are not a second source of
 * truth: the Boss replay recomputes the canonical state from stored history
 * on every load and hands it here, and the write happens only when the
 * stored bytes differ. Replaying twice, saving the same day twice, reloading
 * twice — all write the same thing, which is to say nothing.
