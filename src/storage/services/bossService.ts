/**
 * Per-domain progression and the Boss Rank above it — **the only rank**.
 *
 * A domain here is a rating series and the ladder position the Boss reads
 * from it; the rank, peak rank, rank history and lifetime XP below are the
 * Boss's and nobody else's (Stage 2 of the Overall-rank update).
 *
 * Replayed, never stored — the same rule as everything else derived. Adding
 * this service does not change what RC2 already computes: `loadProgression`
 * still produces the one undivided progression a pre-iteration-2 profile had,
 * and that series is what the Boss uses for every day that predates the
 * upgrade. Nothing here can move a number a user has already seen.
 *
 * ## The two eras, and the join between them
 *
 * Each day resolves to the config snapshot in force on it, and that snapshot
 * decides how the Boss is computed for that day:
 *
 * - **No `boss` field** — the snapshot was written by RC2. That day had one
 *   progression covering everything the user did, so the Boss for it *is*
 *   that progression. It is not a carried-over number seeded at the boundary,
 *   it is the same replay, so pre-upgrade Boss history is exactly what RC2
 *   showed and cannot drift.
 * - **Weights present** — the Boss continues from where the RC2 era left it
 *   and moves by the weighted movement of the domain ledgers.
 *
 * An application upgrade must not create progress or take it away. Replacing
 * the user's standing with a weighted *level* computed a different way would
 * do exactly that on the day it landed; accumulating weighted *movement* from
 * the RC2 era's final value cannot. `bossSeries` holds the formula and the
 * reasoning; this module's job is to feed it truthful per-domain series.
