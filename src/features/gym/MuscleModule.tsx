/**
 * Muskelgruppen: the body and the ten group rows, as one module.
 *
 * **It owns no selection.** The Gym screen holds the one selected group and
 * hands it here; the 3D body, the flat figure that stands in for it and the
 * rows all read that one value, so the body, the list and the exercises
 * below can never disagree about what is selected.
 *
 * A tap on the body **selects**; it never clears. A miss already does
 * nothing, and making a second tap on the same muscle undo the first turned
 * a small aiming error into a lost selection. The rows keep their toggle,
 * where tapping the highlighted row again is a deliberate act.
 *
 * It computes nothing: the visuals are `toBodyVisuals()` and the rows are
 * `toMuscleAnalytics()`, both over what the screen already loaded.
 *
 * The 3D body is behind `React.lazy`, so three.js reaches a device only when
 * this module renders — entering Mental or Ernährung never fetches it. Where
 * WebGL is missing, the chunk cannot be fetched or the viewer throws, the
 * SVG figure takes its place with the same states and the same selection,
 * and the rows below are untouched either way.
