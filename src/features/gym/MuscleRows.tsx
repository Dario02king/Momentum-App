/**
 * The ten muscle groups as one analytical list.
 *
 * Each row answers three questions in the order they are asked: which muscle
 * (the identity dot and the name), when it was last worked and by what, which
 * way it is going (the mini chart), and how far (the number and its state).
 *
 * **Two colour systems, never mixed.** The dot and the chart carry the
 * group's identity colour, which says *which muscle this is* and never
 * changes with performance. The number and the badge carry the state colour,
 * which says *how it is going*. Both come from `features/body/tokens.ts`;
 * there is no chart palette.
 *
 * The rows own no state: the selected group comes from the Gym screen and
 * goes back to it, so the body above and the exercises below always agree
 * with the list.
 */

/**
 * When this group was last worked: "Heute", "Gestern", "Vor N Tagen", or
 * nothing at all where it never was. Terse on purpose — it sits under the
 * muscle's name in a row that also carries a chart and a number, and a
 * sentence there would wrap on a phone.
