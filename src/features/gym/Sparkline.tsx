/**
 * The row's mini chart: 80 × 24, axis-less, no grid, no fill, just the line
 * and a dot on the latest point.
 *
 * Geometry and scale are the approved ones, ported verbatim from the
 * handoff's `spark80()` (see `demo.js` / the design canvas): the points are
 * spread evenly across 74 px with a 3 px margin either side, and the
 * vertical domain is the **displayed series' own minimum and maximum**
 * mapped into 16 px. So each row scales to itself — this says which way a
 * muscle is going, not how it compares with the muscle above it, and the
 * delta beside it carries the magnitude.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating, both from the approved function:
 *
 * - A series whose points are all equal has no span to scale into, and
 *   draws flat down the middle rather than dividing by zero or filling the
 *   box.
 * - A single observation draws its dot and no line: one point is a value,
 *   not yet a direction.
 *
 * Nothing here transforms the numbers it is given. The mapping is to SVG
 * coordinates and lives only in this file; `MuscleTrendPoint.value` stays
 * the raw percentage everywhere else.
