 * from its runs, so it loads on its own and an empty Gym says nothing about
 * it. Before the first run there is nothing to show a rating of, and the
 * card below is where the weekly target is set.
 *
 * It carries no heading of its own: its one host, the Areas screen, already
 * titles the block "Laufen", and the boards inside label themselves.
