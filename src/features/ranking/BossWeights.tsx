/**
 * How much each area counts towards the Boss Rank.
 *
 * The control is **parts, not percentages**. Percentages that have to total
 * exactly 100 are a spreadsheet: every adjustment forces a compensating one
 * somewhere else, and on a phone that is four sliders fighting each other.
 * Parts are what the user actually means — "gym matters twice as much as
 * food" — and the share is arithmetic.
 *
 * The arithmetic is not hidden, which is the other half of the rule. Each row
 * shows its parts *and* the percentage they work out to, the total is stated
 * underneath, and it is always 100 % because it cannot be anything else. There
 * is no save button and no invalid state to save: every reachable combination
 * of parts resolves.
 *
 * Changing this appends a config snapshot, so it applies from today forward
 * and cannot reach a day already lived. The screen says so.
